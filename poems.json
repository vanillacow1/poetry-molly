    "story": "This groundbreaking piece was inspired by a particularly windy day in 1974. The author was sitting in a park when a sudden gust of wind reminded them of the universal nature of bodily functions. The juxtaposition of the sky and 'this guy' represents the connection between all living beings through shared experiences."

    "story": "Written as a meta-commentary on the state of modern poetry, this piece was composed during a poetry workshop where the author felt compelled to bring levity to what they perceived as an overly serious atmosphere. It reflects on the tendency to overthink artistic expression when sometimes the simplest truths are the most profound."

    "story": "Born out of frustration with digital poetry formatting, this instructional poem serves as both a technical guide and an artistic statement. The author was helping someone set up their poetry website when they realized that the technical instructions themselves had a poetic rhythm and decided to preserve them as verse."
